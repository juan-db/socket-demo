# socket-demo
Simple server and client programs I made based on the Oracle lesson on sockets to understand how to communicate using sockets.

Largely based on programs from the Oracle ["All About Sockets"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/index.html) lesson:
- [Server](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/examples/EchoServer.java)
- [Client](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/examples/EchoClient.java)
